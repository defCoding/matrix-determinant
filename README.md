# Matrix Determinant
Just a short Python script that calculates the determinant of a given square matrix.

## Context
Was learning about determinants in Linear Algebra, and the textbook provided a recursive formula for how to calculate the determinant. Wanted to try implementing it in Python so that I could use it to double-check my answers in the homework. It's not optimized by any means, and the book even mentions how this method would take 500,000 years to determine the determinant of a 25x25 matrix on a computer performing 1,000,000,000,000 calculations per second. Given that 500,000 years is slightly longer than the average human lifespan, I would not recommend using this algorithm for large matrices.

## How to Run
Simply run `python determinant.py`, and follow the steps provided in stdout.
